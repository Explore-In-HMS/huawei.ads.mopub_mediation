## **Unity**

This section demonstrates how to use MoPub mediation feature with Huawei Ads Kit on Unity.

Make sure to check the article on [How to use Huawei Ads with Supported Ad Platforms in Unity ?](https://medium.com/huawei-developers/how-to-use-huawei-ads-with-supported-ad-platforms-in-unity-2be08c943a7f)

**Supported Ad Formats are:** Banner Ads, Interstitial Ads and Rewarded Ads.

Firstly, integrate the MoPub Unity SDK to Unity.

For more details on MoPub Unity SDK visit [here](https://developers.mopub.com/publishers/unity/integrate/)

### **Banner Ads**
To use Banner ads in Unity , please check the MoPub Unity SDK. Click [here](https://developers.mopub.com/publishers/unity/banner/) to get more information about Mopub Unity SDKs Banner Ad development. 

### **Interstitial Ads**
To use Interstitial ads in Unity, please check the MoPub Unity SDK. Click [here](https://developers.mopub.com/publishers/unity/interstitial/) to get more information about Mopub Unity SDKs Interstitial Ad development.

### **Rewarded Ads**
To use Rewarded ads in Unity, please check the MoPub Unity SDK. Click [here](https://developers.mopub.com/publishers/unity/rewarded-ad/) to get more information about Mopub Unity SDKs Banner Ad development.

#### **Step 1:** 
Make sure to switch to the Android Platform from **Build Settings -> Android -> Switch Platform**
#### **Step 2:**
**Edit -> Project Settings ->  Player -> Other Settings**<br>
In Other Settings set minimum API level to at least **21**.
#### **Step 3:**
**Edit -> Project Settings ->  Player -> Publishing Settings**<br>
In Publishing Settings select **“Custom Main Gradle Template”** , **“Custom Base Gradle Template”** and **“Custom Greadle Properties Template”** <br>
This will let you override **mainTemplate.gradle** , **baseProjectTemplate.gradle** and **gradleTemplate.properties** files in the project.
#### **Step 4:**
**baseProjectTemplate.gradle** is equal to **project-level gradle** so you have to include **Huawei's Maven repositories** from the Integrate the Huawei Mediation SDK section from [**here**](#integrate-huawei-sdk) <br>
**mainTemplate.gradle** is equal to **app-level build.gradle** so you have to include **dependencies** from the Integrate the Huawei Mediation SDK section from [**here**](#app-level).
#### **Step 5:**
Open **gradleTemplate.properties** and add the following lines
```groovy
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

**After these configurations is completed you can display Huawei Ads.**

**Note:** 
In case of any error on aaptOptions you can add the following line to aaptOptions in **launcherTemplate.gradle** which you override it by enabiling it from **Edit -> Project Settings ->  Player -> Publishing Settings**

```groovy
aaptOptions {
        noCompress = ['.ress', '.resource', '.obb'] + unityStreamingAssets.tokenize(', ')
        ignoreAssetsPattern = "!.svn:!.git:!.ds_store:!*.scc:.*:!CVS:!thumbs.db:!picasa.ini:!*~"
    }
```


## React Native

This section demonstrates how to use MoPub mediation feature with Huawei Ads Kit on React Native apps.

Make sure to check the article on [How to use Huawei Ads with MoPub mediation (React Native)](https://medium.com/huawei-developers/how-to-use-huawei-ads-with-mopub-mediation-react-native-7381cd339098)

**Important:** There is no official React Native SDK for MoPub, therefore third party SDKs has been used in the demonstrations.

Firstly, integrate the React Native MoPub SDK as below depending on type of ad:

For **Interstitial** ad [react-native-mopub-sdk](https://github.com/aliasad106/React-Native-Mopub-SDK) SDK can be used.

**Note:** Developers can find app level build.gradle in their project from __**"app-folder/android/app/build.gradle"**__

Then use the following sample codes based on specific ad types.
  
## Sample Codes Based on Ad Types

### **Banner Ads**

Banner ads are not supported with this SDK. To use banner ads in React Native app, please check the HMS Core Ads Kit React Native SDK. Click [here](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMS-Plugin-Guides/banner-0000001050439147) to get more information about HMS Core React Native SDK.

### **Interstitial Ad**

```jsx
<TouchableOpacity style={{ width: 100, height: 30, backgroundColor: 'red', marginTop: 10 }} onPress={() =>
          RNMoPubInterstitial.loadAd()
        }>
          <Text>
            load ad
                    </Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
```

### **Rewarded Ads**

Rewarded ads are not supported with this SDK. To use Rewarded ads in React Native app, please check the HMS Core Ads Kit React Native SDK. Click [here](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMS-Plugin-Guides/reward-0000001050196920) to get more information about HMS Core React Native SDK.

### **Native Ads**

Native ads are not supported with this SDK. To use Native ads in React Native app, please check the HMS Core Ads Kit React Native SDK.

## Flutter

This section demonstrates how to use MoPub mediation feature with Huawei Ads Kit on Flutter.

Make sure to check the article on [How to show Huawei ads in Flutter using Mopub mediation?)](https://medium.com/huawei-developers/how-to-show-huawei-ads-in-flutter-using-mopub-mediation-9e40adf8e45d)

**Important:** There is no official Flutter SDK for MoPub therefore third party SDKs has been used in the demonstrations.

Firstly, integrate the MoPub Flutter SDK as below depending on type of ad:

For **Banner** , **Interstitial** and **Rewarded** ad types [mopub\_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/mopub_flutter/install) SDK can be used.

**Note:** Developers can find app level build.gradle in their project from __**"app-folder/android/app/build.gradle"**__

**Note:** To avoid **"java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to get provider com.google.android.gms.ads.MobileAdsInitProvider"** error, an Admob ID needs to be added to the application. If both Admob and MoPub are not used in the project, add a sample Admob id to solve this exception.

**Solution:** Add this meta-data tag to the AndroidManifest.xml file (Open android side of the flutter project to edit Manifest file.)

```groovy
<meta-data
 	android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
 	android:value="ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713"/>
```

Then use the following sample codes based on specific ad types.

## Sample Codes Based on Ad Types

### **Banner Ad**
```dart
try {
   MoPub.init('ad_unit_id', testMode: true).then((_) {
_  loadRewardedAd();
_  loadInterstitialAd();
         });
 } 
```
```dart
MoPubBannerAd(
   adUnitId: 'ad_unit_id',
   bannerSize: BannerSize.STANDARD,
   keepAlive: true,
   listener: (result, dynamic) {
     print('$result');
         },
      );
```
### **Interstitial Ad**
```dart
void _loadInterstitialAd() {
  interstitialAd = MoPubInterstitialAd(
    'ad_unit_id',
        (result, args) {
      print('Interstitial $result');
    },
    reloadOnClosed: true,
  );
}
```
```dart
RaisedButton(
    onPressed: () async {
    interstitialAd.show();
    },
   child: Text('Show interstitial'),
 )
 ```
### **Rewarded Ads**
```dart
void _loadRewardedAd() {
  videoAd = MoPubRewardedVideoAd('ad_unit_id',
          (result, args) {
        setState(() {
          rewardedResult = '${result.toString()}____$args';
        });
        print('$result');
        if (result == RewardedVideoAdResult.GRANT_REWARD) {
          print('Grant reward: $args');
        }
      }, reloadOnClosed: true);
}
```
```dart
RaisedButton(
onPressed: () async {
   var result = await videoAd.isReady();
   print('Is Ready $result');
   if (result) {
    videoAd.show();
  }
},
child: Text('Show Video'),
)
```
### **Native Ads**

Native ads are not supported with this SDK. To use Native ads in Flutter app, please check the HMS Core Ads Kit Flutter SDK. Click [here](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMS-Plugin-Guides/native-ads-0000001050198817) to get more information about HMS Core React Native SDK.

## Cordova

Because MoPub ads for Cordova platform is not officially supported and there is no stable MoPub plugin for Cordova, MoPub-Huawei Ads Mediation is not possible on Cordova platform.

Huawei Ads can still be used on Cordova, for implementation click [here](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMS-Plugin-Guides/introduction-0000001050437673).

# Error Codes
**Error code 700** : Your request has been failed. Make sure that you are using test AdUnit Id while testing the mediation.

**Error code 3** : Ad request is successful but the server does not return available ad assets Make sure that you are using test AdUnit Id while testing the mediation.

**MoPubErrorCode "NO_FILL" / "No ads found"** : Make sure that your Custom Event Parameters are correct. Be aware that Custom Event Parameters are JSON's and it shouldn't end with a comma (",").
